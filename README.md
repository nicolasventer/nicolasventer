Hello,

I'm a software engineer, full stack developer.  
I used to program in C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, React.

### Schema Generator

[SchemaGenerator](https://github.com/nicolasventer/SchemaGenerator) is a TypeScript/JavaScript library for generating mock data through a schema.

This library does not have any dependencies but it is recommended to use it with [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) for more realistic data.
